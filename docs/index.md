Navigating the vast landscape of available info was a great challenge when I was just getting into climate science, so I created a spreadsheet. Eventually it grew into an extensive Notion database that I shared with peers. This is an open-source version of that.

The Climate Resource Hub is currently maintained solely by me. If you encounter an outdated link, bug, and/or would like to suggest a new resource, please open a PR on [GitHub](https://github.com/unnobatroo/resource-hub) or [email me](mailto:unnobatroo@icloud.com) and I'll look into it in 5-6 days.
