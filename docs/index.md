Hi, my name is Jaloliddin Ismailov. I built this Hub because navigating climate science resources shouldn't feel like a chore. What initially started as a short spreadsheet for myself has grown into this open-source project for the YOUNGO Science Working Group.

I'm currently maintaining the site alone. If you find a bug or have a suggestion, feel free to open a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/unnobatroo/climate-resource-hub) or [email](mailto:unnobatroo@icloud.com) me directly.
